# Scrimba module 3 - Solo Project \_ Scoreboard

## Diary

The first time I worked on this exercise the JS part was very complicated for to understand. I had to go back to previous classes and also looked at what coleagues were doing to solve the exercise.
Conclusion: I sent the code to be reviewed, it was working the way it was supposed to, but I didn't understand exactly what I had done.

On June/2024 I decided to go back to those exercises in an attempt to trully understand what I was suppose to do and how I would implement the code.
So I reworked the exercise using the method of Problem Decomposition, where I asked questions with the intention to understand the issue and to come up with a solution to it. Making it clear to a non coder to understand.

That worked like a charm, but the solution I came up on my own wasn't too much different than the one I had presented on the first time, the main difference was that I wrote that without looking at anything, not even my previous Js file.

So I checked the code review that I received, and the adjustments suggested by the reviewer made total sense, and could finally understand why she was proposing that.
In summary, the solution would be to concentrate the points to be added in ONE function instead of THREE (one to each point to be incremented), and then pass the points (1, 2 and 3)as arguments.

However, this time I was adding event listeners to each button on JS instead of calling the function on HTML. And that I had no idea how to solve... so I asked ChatGpt how could I pass these arguments. They suggested me to use an arrow funtion, and the explanation is below

### Arrow function to pass an argument

() => addPointsToHomeTeam(1): This is an arrow function. An arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. In this case, it's an anonymous function (i.e., a function without a name) that gets executed when the button is clicked.

addPointsToHomeTeam(1): Inside the arrow function, the addPointsToHomeTeam function is called with the argument 1. This means that every time the button is clicked, the addPointsToHomeTeam function will be called, and it will receive 1 as its argument.
